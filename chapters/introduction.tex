\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
% Delineate the purpose of the software to be specified.

\section{Scope}
% Describe the scope of the software under consideration by:
% a) identifying the software product(s) to be produced by name (e.g., Host DBMS, Report Generator, etc.);
% b) explaining what the software product(s) will do;
% c) describing the application of the software being specified, including relevant benefits, objectives 
% and goals; and
% d) being consistent with similar statements in higher-level specifications (e.g., a system requirements 
% specification), if they exist.

\section{Product Overview}

\subsection{Product Perspective}
% Define the system's relationship to other related products.
% If the product is an element of a larger system, relate the requirements of that larger system to the 
% functionality of the product covered by the SRS.
% If the product is an element of a larger system, identify the interfaces between the product covered by 
% the SRS and the larger system of which the product is an element.
% Consider a block diagram showing the major elements of the larger system, interconnections and 
% external interfaces.
% Describe how the software operates within the following constraints:
% a) system interfaces;
% b) user interfaces;
% c) hardware interfaces;
% d) software interfaces;
% e) communications interfaces;
% f) memory;
% g) operations;
% h) site adaptation requirements; and
% i) interfaces with services.


\subsubsection{System interfaces}
% List each system interface and identify the functionality of the software to accomplish the system 
% requirement and the interface description to match the system.


\subsubsection{User interfaces}
% Specify the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and its users.
% NOTE A style guide for the user interface can provide consistent rules for organization, coding and 
% interaction of the user with the system.


\subsubsection{Hardware interfaces}
% Specify the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the hardware 
% elements of the system. This includes configuration characteristics (number of ports, instruction sets, 
% etc.). It also covers such matters as what devices are to be supported, how they are to be supported, and 
% protocols. For example, terminal support may specify full-screen support as opposed to line-by-line 
% support.


\subsubsection{Software interfaces}
% Specify the use of other required software products (e.g., a data management system, an operating 
% system or a mathematical package), and interfaces with other application systems (e.g., the linkage 
% between an accounts receivable system and a general ledger system).
% For each required software product, specify:
% a) name;
% b) mnemonic;
% c) specification number;
% d) version number; and
% e) source.
% NOTE It is acceptable to specify required platforms or operating systems, but rarely feasible to require a 
% specific version. Typically, a version number most recent version or any currently maintain version can be 
% specified for software.
% For each interface, specify:
% a) discussion of the purpose of the interfacing software as related to this software product;
% b) definition of the interface in terms of message content and format. It is not necessary to detail any 
% well-documented interface, but a reference to the document defining the interface is required.

\subsubsection{Communications interfaces}
% Specify the various interfaces to communications such as local network protocols.


\subsubsection{Memory constraints}
% Specify any applicable characteristics and limits on primary and secondary memory.


\subsubsection{Operations}
% Specify the normal and special operations required by the user such as:
% a) the various modes of operations in the user organization (e.g., user-initiated operations);
% b) periods of interactive operations and periods of unattended operations;
% c) data processing support functions; and
% d) backup and recovery operations.
% NOTE This is sometimes specified as part of the User Interfaces section.


\subsubsection{Site adaptation requirements}
% The site adaptation requirements include:
% a) definition of the requirements for any data or initialization sequences that are specific to a given 
% site, mission or operational mode (e.g., grid values, safety limits, etc.);
% b) specification of the site or mission-related features that should be modified to adapt the software 
% to a particular installation.

\subsubsection{Interfaces with services}
% Specify interactions with services, e.g., Software as a Service (SaaS) or cloud services.

\subsection{Product functions}
% Provide a summary of the major functions that the software will perform. For example, an SRS for an 
% accounting program may use this part to address customer account maintenance, customer statement 
% and invoice preparation without mentioning the vast amount of detail that each of those functions 
% requires.
% Sometimes the function summary that is necessary for this part can be taken directly from the section 
% of the higher-level specification (if one exists) that allocates particular functions to the software 
% product.
% Use cases, user stories and scenarios are also used to describe product functions.
% Note that for the sake of clarity:
% a) the product functions should be organized in a way that makes the list of functions understandable 
% to the acquirer or to anyone else reading the document for the first time.
% b) textual or graphical methods can be used to show the different functions and their relationships. 
% Such a diagram is not intended to show a design of a product, but simply shows the logical 
% relationships among variables.


\subsection{User characteristics}
% Describe those general characteristics of the intended groups of users of the product including 
% characteristics that may influence usability, such as educational level, experience, disabilities and 
% technical expertise. This description should not state specific requirements, but rather should state the 
% reasons why certain specific requirements are later specified in specific requirements in 9.6.9.
% NOTE 1 Where appropriate, the user characteristics of the SyRS and SRS are consistent.
% NOTE 2 For additional information on context of use and user needs, see ISO/IEC 25063 and ISO/IEC 25064.


\subsection{Limitations}
% Provide a general description of any other items that will limit the supplier's options, including:
% a) regulatory requirements and policies;
% b) hardware limitations (e.g., signal timing requirements);
% c) interfaces to other applications;
% d) parallel operation;
% e) audit functions;
% f) control functions;
% g) higher-order language requirements;
% h) signal handshake protocols (e.g., XON-XOFF, ACK-NACK);
% i) quality requirements (e.g., reliability);
% j) criticality of the application;
% k) safety and security considerations;
% l) physical/mental considerations; and
% m) limitations that are sourced from other systems, including real-time requirements from the 
% controlled system through interfaces.

\section{Definitons}
% Provide definitions for any words or phrases that have special meaning beyond normal dictionary definitions.
