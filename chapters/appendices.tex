% List each of the factors that affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These factors are not design 
% constraints on the software but any changes to these factors can affect the requirements in the SRS. 
% For example, an assumption may be that a specific operating system will be available on the hardware
% designated for the software product. If, in fact, the operating system is not available, the SRS would 
% have to change accordingly.
